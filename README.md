# CDP4-Comet Scripts Repository

Welcome to my repository dedicated to **CDP4-Comet** scripts, developed as part of my master's thesis in **aerospace engineering** and intended for future implementations and improvements.

## Repository Contents

This repository collects scripts and tools useful for working with **CDP4-Comet**, a platform for collaborative modeling of complex systems. The scripts contained here have been developed to automate and enhance the software's usage, covering aspects such as:

- **Process automation**: Scripts to simplify data entry and management.
- **Analysis and optimization**: Algorithms for evaluating and improving engineering models.
- **Interoperability**: Tools for integration with other software and data formats.

## Requirements

To use these scripts, you need to have installed **CDP4-Comet-IME**

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/DarioPezzella/Scripts-for-CDP4-Comet.git
